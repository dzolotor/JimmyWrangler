## Jimmy Wrangler

This project accomplishes the following<br>

1.  Set up a data science project structure in a new git repository in your GitHub account<br>
2.  Install  Jupyter  notebook prerequisites (Anaconda, Python, etc.)<br>
3.  Select an industry<br>
4.  Select two to three public data sets from that industry<br>
5.  Load the data sets into panda data frames following the  10 minutes to  pandas  guide<br>
6.  Formulate one or two ideas on how the data sets could be combined to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis<br>
7.  Transform the data sets into a single data set while following data preparation processes to clean and transform features (use  pandas  documentation  for help)<br>
8.  Document your process and results<br>
9.  Commit your notebook, source code, visualizations and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub<br>

## Motivation 

Since the introduction of modern central banking and economic policy, interest rats have mean reverted toward the 3-5% range. As economic cycles progress, central banks adjust interest rates toward zero. It is important to understand how this might effect the value of the dollar as the Federal Reserve Bank corners itself toward 0% rates or even negative rates. Because the national debt is denominted in the nation's own currency, interest rates are unlikely to move up without extreme economic consequences, and we may face a future similar to Japan's recent past.

## Data

I selected two data sets from the Federal Reserve:

    TWEXB- The Trade Weighted U.S. Dollar Index provides a way to judge the purchasing power of the dollar against other currencies.
    1-year Treasury Yield- This yield is a direct result of the Fed Fund Rate

The data is analyzed from Jan. 1996 to Oct. 2019, and it is transformed and merged to create a useable data frame.
It is then plotted in 5 year periods to provide trends in how the dollar index moves as a result of the interest rate set by the Fed.
